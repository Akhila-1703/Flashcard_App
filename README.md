## 📌 About the Project

This Flashcard App allows users to create, store, and quiz themselves using flashcards. It supports adding new flashcards, viewing existing ones, and taking randomized quizzes. The flashcards and user activity are stored using SQLite for persistence.

The application is modularized into key components for clean structure and maintainability:
- `flashcard.py`: Handles creation and management of flashcards.
- `quiz.py`: Manages the quiz logic and question flow.
- `database.py`: Sets up and manages the SQLite database.
- `logger.py`: Logs user interactions for debugging and insights.
- `main.py`: Entry point of the app, providing the command-line interface.
